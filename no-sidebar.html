  <p>To maximize your impact at international and regional forums addressing environmental and human rights issues, strategically planned and targeted interventions are essential. We support our partners to increase visibility, drive meaningful change, and help shape global norms.</p>
<p>Our support spans online advocacy campaigns, in-person human rights trainings, and long-term program development, helping you identify key opportunities based on your work, vision, and organizational priorities. Your thematic focus, geographic context, and legal status define the most effective paths, enabling contributions through precise interventions that engage the stakeholders who matter most.
By aligning your objectives with the right channels and audiences at the United Nations, your initiatives reach decision-makers and influencers capable of turning ideas into real-world impact. Together, we ensure your expertise and solutions are visible, actionable, and capable of inspiring measurable change at both regional and global levels.</p>
  <p>Online advocacy is the starting point for any engagement with the United Nations. Through video statements, virtual meetings, and participation in forums, you can intervene and make your voice heard. These activities allow your perspectives to be amplified, reaching decision-makers and global audiences while laying the foundation for broader advocacy and long-term impact.</p>

  <img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="Pic03" style="float: right; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; width: 480px; height: auto;" />
 <p>For civil society organizations, grassroots groups, and individual researchers, online tools now make meaningful participation in global decision-making far more accessible. What once required a constant physical presence at key UN locations can now be done from anywhere. Virtual meetings, online consultations, written submissions, and pre-recorded video statements allow targeted inputs without the logistical and financial barriers that previously limited access.</p>

<p>Many UN mechanisms actively encourage online participation. Human rights treaty bodies, Special Rapporteurs, and UN working groups regularly invite civil society to join virtual briefings or submit information through online questionnaires. These formats help deliver precise recommendations grounded in local realities. Even brief, two-minute interventions can shape discussions, highlight emerging issues, and bring attention to communities often overlooked.</p>

<p>Online participation is a powerful entry point for shaping global agendas and ensuring that diverse voices are heard.</p>

  <img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="Pic04" style="float: left; margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; width: 480px; height: auto;" />
  <p>The Human Rights Council is the principal United Nations body responsible for strengthening the promotion and protection of human rights around the globe and for addressing situations of human rights violations. Considerable work occurs well before any note, briefing, or report reaches the Council floor; by the time matters are formally presented, much of the key advocacy and preparatory work has already taken place.</p>
<p>This preparatory work is conducted primarily within the UN’s network of subsidiary bodies, thematic working groups, and special procedures. Special Rapporteurs, independent experts, and other specialized consultation mechanisms regularly collect information, solicit civil society input, and produce analyses that subsequently inform deliberations at the Human Rights Council. These spaces are often more accessible and permit highly targeted contributions, making them essential entry points for effective advocacy.</p>
<pAccordingly, any engagement aimed at the Human Rights Council should begin with its subsidiary bodies and related mechanisms. While direct advocacy before the Council can be impactful, it is not always required. Ensuring that information, recommendations, and priorities reach the experts who draft reports and shape agendas is frequently where substantive influence is achieved.p>

  <h3 style="font-size: 2.4em; margin-bottom: 20px;">Our Experience Informs Your Strategy</h3>
  <img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt="Pic08" style="float: right; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; width: 530px; height: auto;" />
  <p>With well over a decade of experience in multiple roles within the United Nations, we bring a deep understanding of how NGOs and civil society operate, supported by a mostly young and always dynamic network of expertise across international, regional, and national human rights mechanisms, treaty bodies, multilateral forums, and advocacy coalitions.</p>

<p>Our work spans the Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals, engaging closely with UN Special Procedures, the Third Committee, the Human Rights Council, UN80, COP, the Escazú Agreement, UNFCCC, and various regional bodies such as the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights (ACHPR), regional sustainable development fora, and other global, regional, and thematic consultations.</p>

<p>Embedded in a global network of human rights defenders and ECOSOC-accredited non-governmental organizations—many of which we have supported in obtaining consultative status—we provide unique insights into the pathways that make advocacy effective at the international level.</p>

<p>We help you identify gaps, uncover strategic opportunities, and create meaningful impact, even in environments shaped by shifting political and geopolitical dynamics. From refining your messaging to shaping your advocacy pitch, we guide you in translating your work into actionable interventions tailored for a specialized global audience. Partnering with us enables you to navigate complex multilateral spaces with confidence and purpose, transforming expertise into tangible influence.</p>

  <img src="images/pic06.jpg" alt="Pic06" style="float: left; margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; width: 480px; height: auto;" />
  <p>Human rights are universal, indivisible, and inalienable. They are inherent to every individual, cannot be lawfully taken away, and are mutually reinforcing, with each right carrying equal significance. Effective human rights advocacy requires a comprehensive understanding of the context in which one operates—whether in diplomatic settings, public demonstrations, national-level engagements between governments and civil society, or international forums. Each environment demands a carefully calibrated approach, informed by local realities, the stakeholders involved, and the broader political and social landscape.</p>

<p>Successful advocacy also necessitates diligent attention to safety. While challenges and risks may arise, including potential reprisals, strategic engagement and rigorous risk assessments help protect both individuals and organizations. Support from mechanisms such as the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights can further enhance these efforts and provide essential safeguards.</p>

<p>We support advocates in designing strategies that are effective, secure, and impactful. From refining messaging to connecting with expert advisors and activating relevant mechanisms, we enable meaningful change while navigating complex human rights spaces with confidence and professionalism.</p>

  <img src="images/pic07.jpg" alt="Pic07" style="float: right; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; width: 480px; height: auto;" />
  <p>Media engagement is a powerful tool for advancing human rights. Sharing information and raising public awareness can play a vital role in protecting communities and encouraging action. By reaching audiences at the local, national, regional, and international levels, you can amplify your message and inspire support for meaningful change.</p>

 <p>Using traditional media, social channels, and digital platforms strategically allows you to spread your ideas, spark informed discussions, and strengthen advocacy efforts. Media engagement is not just about visibility—it is part of a larger approach to sharing information, influencing decision-makers, and reinforcing human rights objectives.</p>

 <p>With our experience and understanding of local contexts, we help you craft messaging that is clear, compelling, and safe. We guide you in using media effectively to reach the right audiences, communicate your goals, and make a lasting impact.</p>
