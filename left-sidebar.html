                        <h3>From Local Action to Global Impact: Navigate the UN</h3>
                    </header>
                    <p>The United Nations isn’t just a set of conference rooms in New York or Geneva – it’s a dynamic stage for human rights defenders, creative minds, and global changemakers. It’s a space where ideas collide, alliances are formed, and voices from around the world are heard. Whether through advocacy, workshops, exhibitions, or even art, the UN offers countless ways to make an impact.</p>

<p>For small NGOs, independent researchers, and larger organizations alike, these forums are more than meetings – they’re opportunities to amplify your message, showcase your work, and connect with others who share your passion for justice, sustainability, and human rights. Imagine your research influencing policy, your projects inspiring collaboration, or your ideas sparking dialogue across continents.</p>

    <img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="NGO engagement at the UN" style="max-width: 100%; width: 300px; height: auto;">
</div>

<p>The UN is also a space for creativity and exchange. Beyond panels and resolutions, there’s room for storytelling, art, and innovative presentations that make complex issues relatable and engaging. It’s where advocacy meets imagination, and where your organization can both represent your community and explore new global opportunities.

<p>And don’t forget – the UN isn’t just sitting in its headquarters in New York, Geneva, or Vienna. Almost every country has national offices, and many agencies, like UN Women, operate locally in dozens of countries. UN processes reach all the way down to the community level, touching the people and issues you work with every day. The trick is knowing how to engage effectively, act strategically, and make the most of the UN’s resources and networks to amplify your impact.</p>

    <h2>How We Work</h2>

</header>

    
<p>We partner with organisations and experts to turn their knowledge and vision into actionable advocacy at regional and global United Nations (UN) fora. From mapping your work to identifying the right opportunities and designing tailored engagement strategies, our support ensures your interventions are strategic, effective, and aligned with your mission.</p>

<p><strong>First, we come to understand your work, then we identify opportunities, and subsequently designing a tailored engagement strategy. More details on those three steps is provided below:</strong></p>


<h3>1. Understanding Your Work and Organisation</h3>
<p>
   </p>

<p>
    <img src="images/pic17.jpg" alt="Team mapping organisational strategy" style="float:right; max-width:100%; height:auto; margin:0 20px 20px 0;">
    We begin with a comprehensive mapping of your organisation, focusing on your strategic vision, thematic priorities, and geographic areas of work. By gaining a clear understanding of your objectives, we can advise on the regional and international UN mechanisms best suited to your goals. This helps you maximize impact and ensures that your interventions are fully aligned with your organisational aspirations.
</p>
<div style="clear:both; margin-bottom:20px;"></div>

<h3>2. Identifying Opportunities for Participation in Regional and Global UN Fora</h3>
<p><strong>Where to Engage: Key Conferences, Human Rights, and Environmental Fora for Your Organisation</strong></p>
<p>We guide you to the most relevant opportunities for engagement, drawing on our organisational analysis and deep knowledge of United Nations systems. Civil society, academic institutions, and individual experts bring unique expertise that can shape global policy and advance human rights and sustainable development.</p>

<p>Participation in UN fora—including the Human Rights Council (HRC), regional sustainable development forums, UNFCCC climate conferences, and key meetings in New York, Geneva, Bonn, Nairobi, and other strategic locations—provides a platform to share your expertise, insights, and perspectives in discussions that shape international norms and policies.</p>

<img src="images/pic19.jpg" alt="Panel discussion at UN event" 
     style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 10px; max-width: 70%; height: auto;">


<p>Engagement at these fora allows your organisation to amplify the voices of marginalized communities, promote social and environmental justice, and contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) across Europe, North America, Latin America, and Africa. By participating in regional and global UN fora, your organisation gains visibility, credibility, and recognition as a trusted partner in international advocacy.

<p>Selecting the right forums is essential. We monitor UN newsletters, official calendars, social media, and regional bodies such as the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights (ACHPR), ensuring that your engagement is targeted and impactful.</p>

<h3>3. Create a Tailor-Made Engagement Strategy</h3>
<p><strong>How to Engage Effectively Across Global and Regional Opportunities</strong></p>

<p>We design a detailed engagement strategy aligned with your organisation’s priorities and objectives. Our support includes:</p>

     style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px; max-width: 50%; height: auto;">

<ul>
    <li>Guidance through registration and accreditation processes to attend in-person meetings in Geneva, New York, Bonn, Nairobi, and other key locations</li>
    <li>Successful design and implementation of Official Side Events at the UN</li>
    <li>Preparation and submission of written or video statements to UN bodies</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on your organisation’s needs, we also provide:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Online and in-person capacity-building programs</li>
    <li>Support to obtain or prepare for ECOSOC consultative status</li>
    <li>Strategic advice on how to leverage UN mechanisms for maximum impact</li>
</ul>

<img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="NGO presenting at UN forum" 
     style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0; max-width: 55%; height: auto;">

<p>Our approach balances long-term accreditation and engagement efforts with immediate, high-impact interventions, ensuring that your contributions are visible, meaningful, and aligned with both regional and global priorities.</p>

<p>We welcome partnerships that amplify the voices of independent civil society organisations, researchers, and individuals, enabling meaningful contributions in line with the mission of the United Nations to address global challenges, promote and protect human rights, uphold the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and advance the implementation of Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals.</p>
